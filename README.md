# News Site - Description
Creating a news site with focus on grid or flexbox and responsive design with mobile first approach.

## The problem 
I had some issues with starting the project before first live session which made it hard to "clean up" the css code since I wrote a lot of things that needed to be replaced. 
I had problem with flexbox so I decided to go for grid instead which I thought was easier. I also had some margins and padding on different containers which made my navbar misplaced. 
I just went through all of my containers one by one and removed those to see what was causing that problem.  

What I could have done differently:
I would have sketched up the project before hand. Instead of creating 1-2 elements and then style them directly. Made it hard to know where in the process I was. If I had more time I would have created subpages for my navbar links and
fint a more suitable color scheme and logo that fits with a news site. I believe the design is a little bit to fluffy and cute.

What I'm proud of:
Im proud of my progress during the week and that I could tackle a lot of problems by googling. I also like that i managed to apply shadow on my pictures within my grid items. Also had some great knowledge sharing with
a classmate and my partner (who also is in the boot camp). We met for 5 hours on saturday to help eachother out which was usefull going forward.
